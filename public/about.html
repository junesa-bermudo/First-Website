<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Junesa Bermudo, an ESL teacher passionate about helping students develop their English language skills. 
    I work from home balancing my professional responsibilities while being a wife and mom to two little girls. 
    My teaching style focuses on practical communication, grammar, pronunciation and vocabular, with a strong emphasis 
    on making learning fun and accessible. Outside of teaching, I love learning and exploring new things. 
    In my free time, I love spending time family and engaging in outdoor activities.</p>
